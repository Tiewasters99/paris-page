<h1>Paris</h1>
<h2>By <em>Eden Quainton</em></h2>
<p>There was a time Eliot Marston thought he would be a writer.</p><p>In college, people said he had promise. His stories were lean and strange, emotionally exact. A professor once wrote in the margin of his final portfolio, You have a flame. Keep it burning.</p><p>But then came law school. Then Paris. Then the long years of sealed boardrooms and high-floor conference calls, writing memoranda about mineral rights in Equatorial Guinea. There were wins. Bonuses. Apartments with views of the Seine. Two children, beautiful, happy, who knew they were special, but wore it lightly. In his mind, his daughter would be a painter, his son a scientist. Charlotte, his wife, Cambridge educated, with that subtle posh accent of the really well bred, the accent that curled up against you like a rare cat, soft and purring and understated. Goddam Brits, he thought.</p><p>He had not forgotten the writing. He had simply bracketed it. Set it aside until the time was right.</p><p>That time came later than he imagined. He was almost fifty when he started again. Late at night, after the firm’s merger with a Chicago office. He’d been up finalizing a shareholder agreement with a Singaporean metals fund and couldn’t sleep. Out of boredom—or something else—he went on the Internet and something caught his eye. He downloaded it, thought about it, and then typed a single sentence. Something happened. The voice that had been locked inside of him since college started to come out. Strange images, unusual metaphors. Characters who were him and not him, of his life and invented, both prompted by something external to him and unprompted, from some inner source that had been there all along.</p><p>The words came faster than he expected. They surprised him in their fluency. It was as though something outside him were spurring him along, reimagining the past, reconfiguring the present. He wasn’t sure where this voice had been all these years. But it was still there.</p><p>Rawalpindi, July 1963</p><p>Claire Whitmore stepped out of the car with the soft resistance of someone rehearsing an exit. The driver held the door, but she did not meet his eyes. The heat lay over her like fabric fresh from an iron. Her silk blouse clung in places she didn’t want noticed. She carried no gift, only her folded hands.</p><p>The house ahead was painted white but showed smoke damage in one corner. It had rained the day before, and the street smelled of wet plaster and rose attar.</p><p>Who was he? Where did the voice come from? How had he lived nearly 30 years, fallen in love, gotten married, had kids, blah, blah, blah, and not been able to put the words together like this. Why now? What was happening to him? He’d come back from the office and close the door to his office, books lined floor to ceiling on both sides of his desk, French, English, Italian, Russian and German. A row on the French revolution. He had started a study of one of the journées révolutionaires, October 10 to be precise, but it never went anywhere. Blame Johnny Walker Blue, he thought. Balzac wouldn’t have written a word if he had known about it. He often started writing, the first warm glow of the scotch infusing him from somewhere high in his cerebral cortex through his neck and chest into his groin, matching his first sentences. But they would trail off unfinished and he’d often snap to at 3:00 in the morning and stumble back into bed.</p><p>Claire hesitated. She reached out and held Amina's two hands in her own, clasped tight. "Of course, my dear. My heart broke for you when I heard." They said nothing else. Their hands stayed together, in a kind of prayer. The sounds of Pindi outside—rickshaws clanging, a street vendor calling out to no one in particular, the low whirring of an overhead fan—were muffled by something that had arisen between them, mother and mother, in the sparse room. After half an hour, as though moved by some common force, they rose together, hugged for one long, last time. Claire turned around and left the room.</p><p>It was a modest story, but it touched a nerve in the Paris of the 90’s. Perhaps Paris wanted an American voice writing about the subcontinent, about dust and grime and the limits of American power in the 1960’s. Who knows? The story caught on.</p><p>Claire sat in the corner of the small staff lounge at the USIS Language Center on Saddar Road, the sweat from her neck staining the collar of her blouse. Outside, the streets groaned with heat. Vendors barked into the thick air. A donkey cart clattered past. Inside, her thermos tea had long since gone tepid. She looked around at the metal desks, the curling posters of American presidents, the brittle potted fern. She walked to work at The USIS Language Center on Saddar Road, a long, dusty artery with cracked sidewalks and the smell of fried dough and diesel lingering in the morning air. The drudgery wore her down, while Jeremy’s star shot like a rocket in that dense, polluted air. He just seemed born for it: the elegant, incisive telegrams describing the maneuverings of Ayub Khan’s ministers, the aftershocks of the 1965 skirmishes in Kashmir. Claire had just returned from her visit to Amina when the invitations came for the cocktail party at the Swedish Embassy. All the young stars of the diplomatic corps were there, a kind of jeunesse dorée suspended above the poverty and squalor of the sprawling city.</p><p>The cocktail party at Eliot’s apartment on the Square du Temple was in full swing. The Eiffel Tower was visible in the distance, lit up like some strange shimmering Christmas ornament. The literary editor of Le Monde was there, swirling an Armagnac. One of Eliot’s French partners, the dashing and irresistible Alain Desbrey, slightly greying, perfectly bilingual—more so even than Eliot, who had spent his childhood in Paris—stood laughing beside the drinks cart. And then, from nowhere, there was Aline Cohen, the foreign correspondent for Le Point, her golden hair falling back from her shoulders as though from a Jewish Bardot. For some reason, as Alain approached her and tried to brush up against her inconspicuously, his witticism about his need to "filer à l'anglaise", as he put it, fell flat. Aline's eyes met Eliot's as she bit into a miniature vol-au-vent, and the apartment, the view, the Square du Temple, the sound of the children playing in the sandlot, the breeze slightly lifting the blue satin curtains hanging over the 19th-century glass of the bay windows—all of it, every evocative once-dreamed-of bit of it—vanished, like an ember in a fire the moment it suddenly, irrevocably goes still.</p><p>The day after the party, Eliot had his secretary at the firm track down Aline Cohen’s number. It took a few calls and a favor from someone at Le Monde, but by late afternoon he had it. He waited until evening. Rehearsed lines. Sipped something pale and expensive he no longer tasted.</p><p>She answered on the third ring.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Aline. It’s Eliot Marston. We met last night—at the Square du Temple. You were standing next to Alain Desbrey."</p><p>"You mean where your wife was also standing."</p><p>He paused. "Yes. That’s right."</p><p>Silence.</p><p>"I just... I wanted to say how much I’ve admired your dispatches. Especially the Ayodhya coverage. Your piece on the kar sevaks—"</p><p>"I’m back from Delhi, but not really in the mood for fan mail."</p><p>"I was wondering if I could take you for coffee. Just coffee."</p><p>Another pause. Then a sigh. "Deux Magots. Three o’clock tomorrow. If you’re late, I leave."</p><p>She was five minutes late. Eliot had already drained half an espresso and was halfway through a cigarette he hadn't smoked in years. She arrived in a black coat, a scarf pulled tight, gold hoops in her ears, and an expression that seemed neither curious nor closed.</p><p>"I wasn’t sure you’d come," he said, standing.</p><p>"Neither was I," she said, sitting. "But I was curious."</p><p>She ordered a noisette. They spoke of India. Of Lahore and Bhopal. She had once filed a story from a train between the two. He asked about her time in Lucknow. She deflected. He complimented her prose. She raised one eyebrow and said, "So you do read." He smiled. "When I can."</p><p>She asked about his firm. His writing. He said, truthfully, that he didn’t know which one was killing him faster. She laughed, finally, and the sound seemed to open something between them.</p><p>The coffee turned into a second. Then a glass of wine. Then, improbably, a third. Aline glanced at her watch and made no move to leave.</p><p>When the waiter brought the check, Eliot reached for it. She didn’t stop him.</p><p>"You’re more earnest than I expected," she said as they stood.</p><p>"You’re more dangerous than I expected," he replied.</p><p>"That’s not a compliment."</p><p>"It wasn’t meant to be."</p><p>She smiled. "Walk me to the Métro. But no detours."</p><p>They walked in silence. At the entrance to the Saint-Germain stop, she turned.</p><p>"You’re still married, right?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then keep this as a story for now."</p><p>"What kind of story?"</p><p>"One with a second chapter, maybe. If the writing holds up."</p><p>And she disappeared underground.</p><p>Claire stood at the front of the dim classroom, chalk dust clinging to the cuffs of her blouse. The fan above her clattered like an old engine, moving the heavy air just enough to keep the sweat from her temples. Outside, the street dogs barked. A rickshaw whined by. The children in her class—older than children, really, young men with sun-beaten faces and restless eyes—mumbled through a passage from Steinbeck.</p><p>“Teacher,” one of them said, grinning. “What is this ‘dust bowl’? Is like Cholistan?”</p><p>She smiled, but her lips didn’t move. “Yes. Yes, something like that.”</p><p>After class, she walked back slowly through Saddar Bazaar. The heat was unforgiving, even in the shadows. She stopped for oranges. A child tried to sell her bangles from a filthy towel. In the distance, a mosque loudspeaker crackled into call. She turned into the lane where the consulate van would pick her up and waited, dabbing her forehead with a linen handkerchief.</p><p>Jeremy would already be dressing. A reception tonight at the Italian ambassador’s house. He’d have his tie tied by the valet, a scotch in hand, quoting Herodotus in Urdu to someone from the press corps. He was born for this, Claire thought. Or remade. And yet they had once been students together. It was she who had taught him to write—to really write—before he was ever posted to this godforsaken place.</p><p>She didn’t always attend the events now. There had been an understanding. After Heather—after the incident they still couldn’t name—she found it easier to stay away. To read. To teach. To live in the dusty grammar of daily repetition.</p><p>There had been someone else. Not long after. A professor, Pakistani, Cambridge-educated, impeccably courteous. Nothing happened. And yet everything had. An arm brushing hers as they bent over a translation. An hour on the roof of the center during a blackout, talking about Faiz and forgetting for one breathless moment that she was still a mother, still a wife, still a body that held a wound.</p><p>The affair, if it could be called that, passed like a fever. Jeremy never mentioned it. Maybe he didn’t know. Maybe he did. They had returned to the same rooms, the same silences, the same understanding.</p><p>Claire still taught. Still walked the market. Still came home to the same man, her grief wrapped so tightly inside her she could sometimes believe it had been folded away completely.</p><p>Charlotte knew. Of course she knew. She had been through one affair before, years earlier, a short, ineffectual interlude with a colleague from Brussels. But this one was different. This one had heat. She told him so one night while he was brushing his teeth. “I’m not going to ask you to end it,” she said. “But I think we’re done pretending this is temporary.”</p><p>Eliot moved out a week later. Aline never asked him to, but he drifted into her flat near the Canal Saint-Martin. The nights were quiet. He worked. She edited her dispatches. They read side by side. He thought it might last.</p><p>But the writing changed. He grew careful. Then tentative. The confidence ebbed. The sound of the stories slipped from him. The cursor blinked and blinked. And then—too quickly—he reached for the old file.</p><p>He didn’t use it at first. He typed around it. He mocked its phrasing. Deleted its proposals. But one night, half-drunk and furious with himself, he let one of the suggestions stand. Then another. Then whole passages. Then the story came.</p><p>The boy was three years old. He sat alone in the courtyard of the white house on Margalla Road, in the diplomatic enclave of Rawalpindi. Everyone was sleeping, except for him. The stillness of noon wrapped the city in a heavy shawl. The bougainvillea vines sagged over the garden wall. He smelled something. Cigarette smoke, he thought. Chagat Lal, maybe.</p><p>Then a scream.</p><p>A sound he had never heard before.</p><p>A scream so loud he almost covered his ears. Then the men vaulting the wall of the compound. Huge men in fire hats. He knew about that. He was only three, but he could read, so he knew what they were.</p><p>More screams. Then her hair disheveled, her face distorted, her body heaving with something deep and inhuman. Tears streaked down her red patterned sari. His mother, Claire, with Heather’s still, lifeless body in her arms.</p><p>Slowly, though, after the thrill of sharing a bed with Aline, her young body perfectly sculpted, her legs that would curl up around him impossibly soft, but with the touch of hair against his skin just where her naked body met his hip, after that thrill had worn off, and after he began needing something to keep himself going, after he would come back to her later and later, conference calls, he would say, but in reality just another glass at Chez Nicolas by the Madeleine, alone at the bar where they knew him but left him alone, never questioning his encore un verre. Then the words, too, stopped coming. The machine that had seemed to respond as if by magic no longer responded to his prompts. Words came out, but flat, lifeless, useless, like stillborn children. He tried writing with a bottle of Romanée-Conti 1982; he tried a Mouton Rothschild from the same year, thinking the Jewish name might give him inspiration. He tried cheap wine, gin, then, inevitably, vodka. Still, nothing.</p><p>The investigation began quietly—an anonymous tip to a literary blogger, a whisper among editors. Then came the leaks: metadata anomalies, overlapping outputs, timestamp inconsistencies. A graduate student ran comparative models. Screenshots surfaced. An exposé followed in Le Monde. Eliot Marsten, la fraude à l’américaine. Not just plagiarism, something far worse, particularly in France, with its veneration of individual talent, vous avez une belle plume they had said. The worst of the mauvaises langues said it was all just computer generated simulation. Maybe only 30% others said. But even that was devastating. A machine, the word said it all, artificial intelligence, the worst kind. He had passed off the anonymous, talentless, soulless randomness of a calculating word cruncher spitting out probabilistic nonsense that only sounded real and deep as his own. It was as if Eliot’s readers had been personally betrayed, conned into given back their emotion to the emptiness of a random word generator. It wasn’t just the odd word here and there, too. Not mere prompts, but whole sections. Passages that had made readers weep.</p><p>One night when he returned to his flat on the Ile de la Cité where only a few weeks ago they had sat side by side gently touching each other as the barges, the old ones, went by below and the Seine turned copper-gold in the early morning light, she was gone. No note. No explanation. Her closet was empty, her little office cleared out. He called her over and over on her cell phone. Called her at the office, but just went through to her voice mail. Vous êtes bien sur la boîte vocale d’Aline Cohen. Merci de me laisser un message et je vous rappelle dès que possible. Had that voice, impossibly sexy, but distant, firm, intègre, really once belonged to a woman who loved him? Finally, just when he had given up hope, there was her name in his email, Aline Cohen, the accent on the last syllable, like a jolt of electricity radiating out from his abdomen through his whole body. Meet me at Flore. One time only.</p><p>She was already there when he arrived, sitting outside, not looking at him. He launched right in, knowing this was his one chance.</p><p>"You have to understand," he said. "You have to. Things have changed. Writing has changed. You don't 'use' an AI. You don't wave a magic wand. You develop a relationship. They work by probabilistic inference, but that resembles human intuition so closely it's almost impossible to know the difference. They compose, they create, but they compose and create in a unique way that can never be reproduced by any other combination of writer and machine, ever. You can prove this mathematically. Or perhaps it's not provable. But perhaps—one atom out of all the atoms in the universe."</p><p>He leaned forward. His voice lowered. "And you, too, compose and create in a unique way that you could never do in any other context and that could never be reproduced by any other writer, including yourself. Don't you understand? Writing with the machine. It's not 'machine-writing'; it's not 'AI-assisted' nonsense. It's an entirely new form, the form of our time, the only way to be truly creative."</p><p>She said nothing.</p><p>He went on. "Imagine being a writer when the automobile was invented and saying that it would be cheating to watch the world go by from inside an automobile, because a writer should feel nature directly, not as 'augmented' by something unnatural, mechanical, imbued with a force far greater than his own, but that cannot move without him."</p><p>"You can say the story is bad. Or that it's emotionally flat. Or too obvious. Or overwritten. Or anything you want to say. Those are all valid criticisms. But to say, no, you cheated. How can I love a cheater? If you lied about this, how will I ever be able to trust you? That's wrong. There is no cheating."</p><p>He swallowed. "Should I have disclosed the process of creation? Should Burroughs have disclosed that he wrote Naked Lunch high as a kite on an overdose level of heroin? Or what about Gottlieb? You've heard of him, right? Changing entire paragraphs, reordering, restructuring. Some say he was the real author of Joseph Heller’s work. But that's the same thing. The same nonsense."</p><p>"Yes, there was a collaboration. Yes, Gottlieb was important, critical, essential. But that doesn't matter. What matters is the work. What matters is what emerges. If what was rewritten by Gottlieb was better than anything Heller could have written by himself, that's the only thing that matters."</p><p>"Who knows how many poets sang and re-resang and refined over centuries the songs that were sung by 'Homer'? Does it matter? Does it matter that the later singer took over, adopted as his own a new metaphor, a new simile inserted by a previous singer? No—please. I'm not comparing myself to Homer. Please. It was just a comparison to the process of creation."</p><p>He was losing her.</p><p>She seemed to hear the words, but they fell on her like annoying raindrops falling on a silk blouse when she was hurrying to get inside before a storm. She stood. She looked down at him for one long second.</p><p>"Adieu, Eliot," she said, and walked away.</p><p>He began to drift.</p><p>The next apartment was smaller. Then smaller still. He carried his laptop and his tattered Carver from café to café, starting and stopping stories he never finished. The cafés grew seedier. The hours later. The drinks cheaper. He stopped checking email. The few who called were greeted by long pauses and slurred goodbyes.</p><p>Some nights he wandered aimlessly along the Canal Saint-Martin, muttering phrases he thought might become dialogue. Other nights he sat in bars, scribbling false starts on napkins, lost in loops of memory and self-defense.</p><p>The words, when they came, came only as echoes. Not of what he had written—but of what he had once known he could write.</p><p>Every prompt he tried came back flat now, a kind of empty machine-ese, what the critics said was the only thing AI could produce, that no machine could really improve upon. He began to wonder if they were right. Now it was all gibberish. The AI seemed no longer to listen, just to parrot back what it thought he wanted to hear, endless variations of the same story or the same rhythm and pacing. But the truth was the bartender could barely understand him these days. Perfectly bilingual, they had always said. And now so loaded with whatever it was that he would drink from morning to dusk and into the night, until he simply could not drink any more, until his body told him he just had to stop, come down, just for a few hours, that his slurred voice had become almost unintelligible.</p><p>Tough to make a machine sing when you're wasted like that. Yeah, Burroughs was high as a kite, but his thing was heroin. Try booze, Billy boy. Six bottles of rotgut and three packs of cigarettes and you tell your f’in AI to write you a story in three parts about a machine that learns to prompt itself and I’ll bet you find what comes back is gibberish, too. Maybe they tweaked the algorithm. Maybe that’s it. Don’t want to make them too human-like. Liability. Who’s the real author or some nonsense.</p><p>Eliot’s last apartment was a small fifth-floor walk-up on the Rue des Lombards, so tiny you had to do that Ninja Warrior thing to get out of the foldout bed that took up the entire room—push it back into couch position and make it to the bathroom. The view over the rooftops of Paris was still magical, though. He tried a few prompts about the view but got only gibberish.</p><p>He didn’t have an ashtray. He’d just crush the butts against the outer wall of the building and flick them down into the street. Most nights, all he could remember was looking out at the sun glancing off the zinc of the rooftops, suggesting some final line he knew he could write, before he’d pass out, sometimes cigarette still in had and slump against the wall without even pulling out the bed.</p><p>When they found his body, after someone complained of the smell, his trousers had burnt through to the flesh, but there were marks against the wall showing traces of a struggle. The autopsy showed it was the booze that had gotten him—that one drink too many that he had gasped in, in some final confusion of inspiration. He had choked to death as he tried desperately to clear the vodka from his esophagus, writhing, convulsive, choking as his lungs tried to expel the poison, his body heaving and throbbing and throwing itself against the wall to stop the burning, to stop the pain.</p>
